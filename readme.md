# Copy to Workflowy Inline Linking

> This addon is forked from [Copy to Workflowy](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/copy-to-workflowy/)

Since workflowy had a new function, now we can use inline linking then not put the link in the note, so I forked a new one.

A [Firefox Addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/copy-to-workflowy/) to copy the current tab to [Workflowy](https://workflowy.com).

> This extension will add a Workflowy.com icon to your toolbar. When you want to add a certain page to your notes, just click the icon. It will copy the page title and URL to the clipboard. Then go to your Workflowy notes and paste it wherever you want.
>
> You can also use the keystroke Alt+W (on Mac use Option+W) to copy the current page address.
>
> Please not that this extension does not work on https://addons.mozilla.org due to restrictions from Mozilla.
